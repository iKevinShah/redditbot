# redditbot

Simple Image to technically run a python script in a separate container, but this one is specifically for a reddit bot based on `praw` (https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). Pretty easy to set it up. 

**Note:** The demo bot script in here is not mine. [/u/doug89](https://www.reddit.com/user/doug89 "/u/doug89") is the owner of the bot code.

Pull the image

````bash
[root@docker01 ~]# docker pull ikevinshah/redditbot
Using default tag: latest
latest: Pulling from ikevinshah/redditbot
...
Status: Downloaded newer image for ikevinshah/redditbot:latest
docker.io/ikevinshah/redditbot:latest

````

Check if the image exists.
````bash
[root@docker01 ~]# docker image ls ikevinshah/redditbot
